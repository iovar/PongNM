You can play human-vs-human, human-vs-pc and pc-vs-pc. On human-vs-pc, 
regardless of which side you choose for yourself, the opponent is going
to use the AI level indicated by the "First AI Level" selection.

Controls are up-down arrows, in single player mode, while in human-vs-human
player 1 gets the key 'w' for up and the key 's' for down, while player 2
gets the arrows.
